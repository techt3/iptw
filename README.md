## Game Philosophy: Breaking Out of Digital Bubbles

In our interconnected world, most internet traffic flows through a handful of major hosting platforms and CDNs located in just a few countries. This creates digital "bubbles" where we unknowingly consume content from a very limited geographic and cultural perspective.

**IPTW challenges you to:**
- **Escape the hosting monopoly**: Discover websites hosted outside major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- **Find authentic local voices**: Seek out small community newspapers, local blogs, and regional websites
- **Break news bubbles**: Access diverse perspectives by connecting to servers in different countries
- **Explore digital diversity**: Experience the internet as it was meant to be - truly global and decentralized

The game rewards curiosity and geographic diversity over convenience, encouraging you to venture beyond the mainstream digital highways.


## How It Works: Travel Mechanics

- **Virtual Travel**: Each network connection to a foreign IP address represents a "visit" to that country
- **Progressive Country Coloring**: Countries change appearance based on your visit frequency:
  - **1-9 visits**: Display national flag background (fresh destinations worth exploring)
  - **10+ visits**: Countries become "boring" and display sand/rocks gradient patterns (time to find new places!)
  - **Continued Activity on Boring Countries**: When boring countries receive additional hits, their patterns show slight variations to indicate ongoing activity
- **Exploration Incentives**: 
  - **Target Countries**: Red borders highlight unvisited countries, encouraging global exploration
  - **Achievement System**: Unlock achievements by visiting all countries in geographic regions
  - **Fastest Traveler Achievements**: Special rewards for marking target countries as boring quickly
  - **Discovery Rewards**: Special recognition for finding rare hosting locations
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch your virtual travel map expand as you browse, with live connection points
- **Wallpaper Generation**: Your journey becomes a personalized, ever-changing desktop background

## Fastest Traveler Achievement System üöÄ

### New Feature: Strategic Country Targeting
IPTW now includes a dynamic achievement system that rewards strategic gameplay when dealing with target countries:

#### How It Works
- **Target Countries**: The game automatically selects random unvisited countries as targets (highlighted with red borders)
- **Fastest Traveler Achievement**: When you mark a target country as "boring," you earn a unique achievement
- **Immediate Target Rotation**: A new target is selected instantly after earning the achievement

#### Two Ways to Earn
1. **Automatic**: Visit a target country 10 times until it becomes boring automatically
2. **Manual**: Use the web API to manually mark a target country as boring

#### API Usage
```bash
# Mark the current target country as boring
curl -X POST http://localhost:32782/countries/boring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"country": "United States"}'
```

#### Benefits
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Encourages focused targeting of specific countries
- **Unique Achievements**: Each country gets its own "Fastest Traveler to [Country]" achievement
- **Dynamic Content**: Achievements are created on-the-fly as you play
- **Competitive Element**: Race to mark targets before they naturally become boring

#### Testing
Use the web API to test the new feature:
```bash
# Mark the current target country as boring
curl -X POST http://localhost:32782/countries/boring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"country": "United States"}'
```

## Configuration

IPTW uses a configuration file to customize behavior and positioning. Configuration files are located at:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.config/iptw/iptwrc`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\iptw\iptwrc`

The configuration file is automatically created with default values on first run. Common parameters include:

### Display Settings
- `map_width`: Width of the world map in pixels (default: 1000)
- `auto_detect_screen`: Automatically detect screen size (default: true)
- `black`: Use dark theme for map colors (default: false)

### Game Statistics Positioning
For users with smaller screens where game statistics may be drawn outside the visible area, you can manually position the stats rectangle:

- `stats_x`: X position of the game statistics rectangle (default: -1 for auto-positioning)
- `stats_y`: Y position of the game statistics rectangle (default: -1 for auto-positioning)

**Auto-positioning behavior** (when `stats_x` and `stats_y` are set to -1):
- Statistics are positioned in the bottom-left corner with automatic margins
- Position is calculated as a percentage of screen size for responsiveness

**Manual positioning** (when `stats_x` and `stats_y` are set to specific values):
- Statistics are positioned exactly at the specified pixel coordinates
- Values are constrained to keep the rectangle within screen bounds
- Useful for smaller screens or specific layout preferences

**Example configuration for manual positioning:**
```
stats_x 50    # Position stats 50 pixels from left edge
stats_y 100   # Position stats 100 pixels from top edge
```

### Performance Settings
- `update_interval`: Seconds between wallpaper updates (default: 1)
- `target_interval`: Minutes between target country changes (default: 5)
- `log_level`: Logging verbosity: debug, info, warn, error (default: info)

**Cross-Platform Service Support:**
- **macOS**: LaunchAgent (starts on user login)
- **Linux**: systemd user service (starts on login)  
- **Windows**: Windows Service (starts on system boot)

## Wallpaper Backup & Restore

IPTW automatically backs up your original desktop wallpaper before making any changes and can restore it when the application exits or on demand.

### Automatic Backup & Restore
- **Automatic Backup**: On the first wallpaper change, IPTW automatically saves your current wallpaper
- **Graceful Shutdown**: When IPTW exits (Ctrl+C or SIGTERM), it automatically restores your original wallpaper
- **Backup Location**: Wallpaper backups are stored in `~/.config/iptw/output/` with timestamps

### Manual Restore via API
If you need to restore your original wallpaper while IPTW is still running:

```bash
# Restore original wallpaper via HTTP API
curl -X POST http://localhost:32782/wallpaper/restore
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Original wallpaper restored successfully"
}
```

### Supported Platforms
- **macOS**: Full support using AppleScript
- **Linux**: GNOME, XFCE, and basic support for other desktop environments
- **Windows**: Full support using Windows API

### Troubleshooting
- If backup fails, IPTW will continue running but warn that restore functionality won't be available
- KDE Linux support is limited - backup may not work perfectly on all KDE configurations
- Backup files are automatically cleaned up on application restart

### Testing
Test the wallpaper backup functionality:
```bash
# Run the test script
./scripts/test-wallpaper-backup.sh
```

## Server-Client Mode 

IPTW now supports server-client functionality for remote monitoring and statistics sharing:

### Server Mode 
Run IPTW with a built-in HTTP statistics server:
```bash
# Start with statistics server on port 32782
./iptw -server

# Use custom port
./iptw -server -port 9090
```

### Client Mode
Connect to a remote IPTW server to view statistics:
```bash
# View stats from default server (localhost:32782)
./iptw -client

# Connect to remote server
./iptw -client -server-url http://192.168.1.100:32782

# Show achievements
./iptw -client -achievements

# Show country details
./iptw -client -countries

# Watch mode: continuously poll for updates
./iptw -client -watch -interval 30
```

### Use Cases
- **Remote Monitoring**: Monitor IPTW statistics from another machine
- **Dashboard Integration**: JSON API for custom dashboards (`/stats/json`)
- **Achievement Tracking**: Monitor progress across multiple instances
- **Team Challenges**: Share statistics for group competitions
