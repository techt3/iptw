# IP Travel Wallpaper (iptw)

IP Travel Wallpaper transforms your network browsing into a gamified world exploration experience. As you visit websites and connect to servers around the globe, your digital footprints are visualized as virtual travels on a beautiful world map that becomes your desktop wallpaper.

## Game Philosophy: Breaking Out of Digital Bubbles

In our interconnected world, most internet traffic flows through a handful of major hosting platforms and CDNs located in just a few countries. This creates digital "bubbles" where we unknowingly consume content from a very limited geographic and cultural perspective.

**IPTW challenges you to:**
- **Escape the hosting monopoly**: Discover websites hosted outside major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- **Find authentic local voices**: Seek out small community newspapers, local blogs, and regional websites
- **Break news bubbles**: Access diverse perspectives by connecting to servers in different countries
- **Explore digital diversity**: Experience the internet as it was meant to be - truly global and decentralized

The game rewards curiosity and geographic diversity over convenience, encouraging you to venture beyond the mainstream digital highways.


## How It Works: Travel Mechanics

- **Virtual Travel**: Each network connection to a foreign IP address represents a "visit" to that country
- **Progressive Country Coloring**: Countries change appearance based on your visit frequency:
  - **1-9 visits**: Vibrant colors from green to orange (fresh destinations worth exploring)
  - **10+ visits**: Countries become "boring" and turn red (time to find new places!)
- **Exploration Incentives**: 
  - **Target Countries**: Red borders highlight unvisited countries, encouraging global exploration
  - **Achievement System**: Unlock achievements by visiting all countries in geographic regions
  - **Discovery Rewards**: Special recognition for finding rare hosting locations
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch your virtual travel map expand as you browse, with live connection points
- **Wallpaper Generation**: Your journey becomes a personalized, ever-changing desktop background

## Game Goals & Challenges

### üéØ **Primary Objectives**
1. **Visit All Countries**: Can you find internet content hosted in every nation?
2. **Regional Completion**: Complete entire continents by discovering local hosting
3. **Rare Country Hunter**: Find websites in countries with minimal global hosting presence
4. **Local News Explorer**: Discover authentic local newspapers and community sites
5. **Escape the Big Three**: Minimize connections to US, EU, and Chinese mega-platforms

### üåç **Discovery Challenges**
- **Small Nation Challenge**: Find active websites hosted in microstates and island nations
- **Language Diversity**: Connect to servers hosting content in minority languages
- **Community Voices**: Discover local radio stations, newspapers, and blogs
- **Academic Networks**: Find university and research institution servers worldwide
- **Government Transparency**: Access official government websites hosted locally
- **Cultural Preservation**: Find sites dedicated to local traditions and heritage

### üì∞ **Breaking News Bubbles**
The modern internet is dominated by a few major hosting providers, creating invisible geographic barriers to information diversity. IPTW helps you discover:
- **Hyperlocal News**: Small-town newspapers and community bulletins
- **Alternative Perspectives**: Non-Western viewpoints on global events
- **Underrepresented Voices**: Media from developing nations and marginalized communities
- **Direct Sources**: Government, academic, and institutional websites hosted locally
- **Cultural Content**: Local entertainment, art, and cultural preservation sites
